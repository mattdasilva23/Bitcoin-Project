To run the Bitcoin app:

1 - Download repository from GitHub

2 - Navigate to 'dist' folder

3 - Open bitcoin.bat

A console window will open and you will then be asked to enter a 'duration' and 'interval' and the program will run.

There is also a bitcoin.py file in the repository - this is just for viewing the source code.

No building required.
